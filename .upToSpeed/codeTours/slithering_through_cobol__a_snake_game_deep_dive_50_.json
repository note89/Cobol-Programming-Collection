      "description": "Welcome to this code tour of the Snake game implemented in COBOL! As a TypeScript engineer, you're about to embark on an interesting journey through a classic game built with a language quite different from what you're accustomed to.\n\nLet's start with a quick overview of the Snake game:\n- Objective: Control a snake to eat food and grow without colliding with walls or itself\n- Key elements: Snake, food, game board, movement, growth, and collision detection\n\nNow, why explore this in COBOL? While TypeScript is a modern, object-oriented language with dynamic typing and ECMAScript features, COBOL is a much older, procedural language designed for business applications. This contrast will provide you with valuable insights into different programming paradigms.\n\nThroughout this tour, we'll explore:\n1. How COBOL structures programs (divisions and sections vs. TypeScript's modules and classes)\n2. Variable declarations and data structures in COBOL (compared to TypeScript's type system)\n3. Control flow and game loop implementation (procedural vs. event-driven approaches)\n4. Input handling and screen updates (terminal-based vs. DOM manipulation)\n\nBy the end of this tour, you'll have a detailed understanding of how Snake is implemented in COBOL. More importantly, you'll gain insights into how fundamental programming concepts transcend language boundaries, which can enhance your problem-solving skills in TypeScript and beyond.\n\nLet's dive in and start exploring the COBOL implementation of Snake!",

This is done using a PERFORM VARYING loop, which is similar to a for loop in TypeScript, but counting backwards.\n2. After shifting, it sets the new position of the head (first segment) to the nextSnakeCol and nextSnakeRow calculated earlier.\n3.

Game Board: The game board is represented as a 2D array where each cell can be empty, contain a part of the snake, or food.\n2. Snake Movement: The snake moves by updating the positions of its body segments. The head moves based on the current direction, and each body segment takes the position of the segment in front of it.\n3. Growing: When the snake eats food, a new segment is added to the end of the snake, effectively making it grow.\n\nThese fundamental concepts are similar across most Snake implementations, regardless of the programming language used.",

It detects if the snake has hit the wall (game board boundaries) or itself (any part of its body). If a collision is detected, the game ends.\n2. User Input Handling: The game continuously checks for user input to change the snake's direction. It ensures that the snake can't immediately reverse its direction, which would result in an instant collision with itself.\n\nThese mechanics are essential for creating the challenge and interactivity of the Snake game.",
